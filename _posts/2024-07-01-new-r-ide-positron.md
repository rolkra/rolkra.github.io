title:  New R IDE Positron (from Posit)!
---

Positron is in early beta, but still promising. Take a look!

### Install

You can find positron here: <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases>

Select the latest version and go to "Assets". There you find different installers for windows/mac/linux.

The wiki gives you more background infos: <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/wiki>

### Get Started

Once you have installed Positron, create a new R file (select menu File > New File > R File).

In my case, Positron already found my R installation, I was ready to go!

Running R code works as expected (including code completion)

### Dark Mode

You can switch easily to dark mode by selecting the settings-icon on the bottom left of the screen. And then selecting Themes > Color Theme

### Data Explorer

I really like the built in data explorer. On the left you can see an overview of all variables with percentage of NULL values. And you can define a filter easily.

### Conclusion

Postiron is promising. It may become a great IDE for R and Python users that combine the best of both worlds from VSCode and RStudio IDE.
