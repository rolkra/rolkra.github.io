title:  Retro games {creepyalien}, {pixelpuzzle} & {codebreaker}
---

Have fun with these 3 retro games written in R:

I just finished my "trilogy" of retro ðŸ•¹ games written in R. {creepyalien} completes {pixelpuzzle} and {codebreaker}

{creepyalien}
You are an alien ðŸ‘½ lost in a graveyard and have until midnight to find your way to your ship ðŸ›¸. 
Skeletons ðŸ’€ are waiting to scare you to death should you come to close. You can dig up to 5 holes to help keep them away. 
The owl ðŸ¦‰ may give you some extra time!

{pixelpuzzle}
Select one of the pixel arts (Mario, Yoshi, Space Invaders, ...) and try to restore the pixel art by shifting rows!

{codebreaker}
You are a codebreaker and play against the computer who is the codemaker. 
The computer chooses a pattern of four colors (duplicates possible). 
You try to break the code by trying color patterns. The computer tells you the number of correct colors. 
Try to break the code in less steps as possible!

All 3 games are available on CRAN. Have fun!
