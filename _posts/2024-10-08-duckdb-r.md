Using DuckDB with R is such a great experience!

### Install

Never heared of DuckDB? Check this website: <https://duckdb.org/>

Installation is easy:

```R
install.packages("duckdb")
```

To create your first local duckdb simply run:

```R
library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), "mydatabase.duckdb")
```

If you don't provide a file name, the duckdb will be in memory.
